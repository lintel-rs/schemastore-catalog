Use this option to supply an additional list of exclude\npatterns.\n\nExclude patterns are modeled after what you can provide in a\n[.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), and are resolved relative to the\nparent directory that your `jarl.toml` is contained within. For example, if your\n`jarl.toml` was located at `root/jarl.toml`, then:\n\n- `file.R` excludes a file named `file.R` located anywhere below `root/`. This is\n  equivalent to `**/file.R`.\n\n- `folder/` excludes a directory named `folder` (and all of its children) located\n  anywhere below `root/`. You can also just use `folder`, but this would\n  technically also match a file named `folder`, so the trailing slash is preferred\n  when targeting directories. This is equivalent to `**/folder/`.\n\n- `/file.R` excludes a file named `file.R` located at `root/file.R`.\n\n- `/folder/` excludes a directory named `folder` (and all of its children) located\n  at `root/folder/`.\n\n- `file-*.R` excludes R files named like `file-this.R` and `file-that.R` located\n  anywhere below `root/`.\n\n- `folder/*.R` excludes all R files located at `root/folder/`. Note that R files\n  in directories under `folder/` are not excluded in this case (such as\n  `root/folder/subfolder/file.R`).\n\n- `folder/**/*.R` excludes all R files located anywhere below `root/folder/`.\n\n- `**/folder/*.R` excludes all R files located directly inside a `folder/`\n  directory, where the `folder/` directory itself can appear anywhere.\n\nSee the full [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) documentation for\nall of the patterns you can provide.",
